Roy Fielding's thesis [captures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9) various architectural styles that make up REST. REST has an _is a_ relationship with each of the individual styles. E.g., REST _is a_ client-server style. Such statement in itself says a lot; just as much a statement 'whale is a mammal' would say about a whale.

Like REST, many architectural styles are composites, but so are software design tools [^1]. A design tool is a composite of multiple (relatively) primitive design tools. For example, polymorphism is based on **Generalization** which itself is based on **Abstraction**. 

There isn't any formal classification (that I know) of design tools, probably because its considered common knowledge. However, it would be something very useful if it were to exist today. It establishes a knowledge base of building blocks of design. 

For example, its known that microservices provide isolation. But it would not be much if the abstraction (type/scope/nature of services it provides) does not provide low coupling/high cohesion. (See image below)

What does such classification look like? I have tried to create one for some commonly used design approaches (OOAD, DDD etc) and their elements. See image below [^2].

How to read the image (its similar to [this](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9)):

- An arrow depicts the contribution of one design tool in the formation of the other at arrow head.
- Multiple arrow heads mean that a tool is a composite. E.g., High Cohesion is formed from abstraction (a common concept necessitating things sticking together) and divide-and-conquer (division of the problem space with different granularities of concepts)

Now, here are some useful observations I made from the image

- You dont have to take anyone's word for granted when they say 'Abstraction' is the most powerful design tool ever!
- Modeling is a close second, but you can make your own inferences.
- There seem to be plenty of items derived from ALcHcDc (A name obtained by concatenating individual styles). ALcHcDc provides isolation. Isolation seems to be the most in-demand trait.

[^1]: I use 'design tool' as opposed to 'design principle', because a principle in common usage today refers to something concrete like 'single responsibility principle'. I found the word 'tool' to be more appropriate, because it is a thing you can apply and achieve something.

[^2]: I confess that the image may not be 100% accurate. I am not an academician. This image was originally my notes. I have been using it for discussions with colleagues in my organization. It has been evolving over time as I learn more and put more thought into their relationships.
