Roy Fielding's thesis derives REST from various architectural styles. His derivation graph (shown below for convenience) shows simpler styles combining and evolving into composite styles while the traits are combined and mixed in the process. Roy traces REST's final resultant traits from the graph [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_9).

Software design tools are also composites. A design tool (for lack of a better name [^1]) is a tool, when applied, solves a design problem. Divide-and-conquer is a good example, although it is not specific to software domain. Such a tool could combine and evolve resulting in composite design tools. For example, Polymorphism is derived from Typing, which is based on [Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization) which itself is based on Abstraction. 

So, what would a derivation for design tools look like? I created one [^2] for design tools used in couple of common design approaches such as OOAD & DDD. See image below.

How to read this image (its similar to [this](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9)):

- An arrow depicts the contribution of one design tool in the formation of the other at arrow head.
- Multiple arrow heads mean that a tool is a composite. E.g., Separation of Concerns is formed from abstraction (a common concept necessitating things sticking together) and divide-and-conquer (division of the problem space with different granularities of concepts)
- Arrow labels indicate an abstract concept that forms a basis.

Here is an illustration of its usefulness:

It is known that microservices provide isolation. But it is not automatic. The abstraction (type/scope/nature of services it provides) must be good enough to provide low coupling/high cohesion.

<br/>

Here are a couple more observations I made

- Abstraction is the most powerful design tool ever!
- Isolation seems to be the most in-demand trait. 
    - There seem to be plenty of approaches designed to achieve isolation. It seems to be the most in-demand trait.

[^1]: I use 'design tool' as opposed to 'design principle', because a principle, in common usage today, refers to something concrete like 'single responsibility principle'. I found the word 'tool' to be more appropriate, because it is a thing you can apply and achieve something.

[^2]: I confess that the image may not be 100% accurate. This image was originally my notes. I have been using it for discussions with colleagues in my organization. It has been evolving over time as I learn more and put more thought into their relationships.
