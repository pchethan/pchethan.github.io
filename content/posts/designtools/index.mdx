Roy Fielding's thesis [captures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9) various architectural styles that REST is composed of. REST has an _is a_ relationship with each of the individual styles. E.g., REST _is a_ client-server style. Such statement in itself says a lot; just as much a statement 'whale is a mammal' would say about a whale.

Like REST, many architectural styles are composites, but so are software design tools [^1]. A design tool is a tool, when applied, solves a design problem. Well known example: 'divide-and-conquer'. Such a tool could be a composite of multiple (relatively) primitive design tools. For example, polymorphism is based on **Generalization** which itself is based on **Abstraction**. 

There isn't any formal classification (that I know) of design tools, probably because its considered common knowledge. However, it would be something very useful if it were to exist. 

For example, it is known that microservices provide isolation. But, not be much if the abstraction (type/scope/nature of services it provides) does not provide low coupling/high cohesion. (See image below). You see now?

What does such classification look like? I have tried to create one for some commonly used design approaches (OOAD, DDD etc) and their elements. See image below [^2].

How to read this image (its similar to [this](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#fig_5_9)):

- An arrow depicts the contribution of one design tool in the formation of the other at arrow head.
- Multiple arrow heads mean that a tool is a composite. E.g., High Cohesion is formed from abstraction (a common concept necessitating things sticking together) and divide-and-conquer (division of the problem space with different granularities of concepts)
- Arrow labels indicate an abstract concept that forms a basis.

Now, here are some useful observations I made from the classification

- Proof that Abstraction is the most powerful design tool ever!
- To me, Modeling is a close second, but you can make your own inferences.
- There seem to be plenty of items derived from ALcHcDc (A name obtained by concatenating individual styles). ALcHcDc provides isolation. Isolation seems to be the most in-demand trait.

[^1]: I use 'design tool' as opposed to 'design principle', because a principle in common usage today refers to something concrete like 'single responsibility principle'. I found the word 'tool' to be more appropriate, because it is a thing you can apply and achieve something.

[^2]: I confess that the image may not be 100% accurate. I am not an academician. This image was originally my notes. I have been using it for discussions with colleagues in my organization. It has been evolving over time as I learn more and put more thought into their relationships.
