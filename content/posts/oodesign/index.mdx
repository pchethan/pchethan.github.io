## 5 Attributes of Complex Systems
In their popular book "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications", the authors (Grady Booch et al), list and describe attributes of successful complex systems:
- Hierarchical Structure
- Separation of Concerns
- Economy of expression
- Relative Primitives
- Stable intermediate forms

Although the authors cite various good examples, the success of world wide web itself is enough to convince anyone.

# OOD to Build Complex Systems

The authors posit that object modeling and elements of object oriented design synergestically help us towards building such systems. The book was written years ago and we now do know that this is true because many large systems have been built predominantly with OO-X.

## How?
The book elaborates on how specific features of OO design help achieve the individual attributes of a complex system, but here is a gist (mine).

The image shows how various elements of OOD contribute in different ways and extents, via their abstract design forms

For reference, here are the OO features and their relationship with more generic forms (arrow is derivation)

## Utility
The fact that all roads lead to the 5 attributes via one or more generic design tools is immensely useful in evaluating new design methodologies or tools, or in the least in being aware of the extent to which a design approach helps.

For e.g., the popular SOLID principles only help to an extent shown in the image. They help with the managing separation of concerns, but little or no contribution towards hierarchical structure of economy of expression.
